What went well this deliverable?
- Finished REST endpoint in 3 days, from having no idea what was going on to successfully finishing it
- Hardwork and dedication
- Things become easier as I get used to TypeScript syntax
What went poorly?
- Lacking of cooperation with my teamamte
How you will approach the next deliverable differently?
- Look at autotest to distribute workload more evenly
