What went well this deliverable?
- Finished addDataset in 2 weeks
- Hardwork and dedication
What went poorly?
- Inefficiency (spent too much time on addDataset, as I wasn't familiar with TypeScript)
- Got confused 70% of the time
How you will approach the next deliverable differently?
- Look at autotest to distribute workload more evenly
